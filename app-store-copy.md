## Description

```
Uncorked helps you remember the wines you love.

Snap a photo of any wine label and let Uncorked do the rest. The app automatically extracts the wine's name, winery, region, and grape varieties — no typing required.

BUILD YOUR COLLECTION
Keep track of every bottle you've tried. Add your own tasting notes, rate wines with a simple 5-star system, and never forget that perfect dinner wine again.

YOUR WISHLIST
Spotted an interesting bottle at a shop? Found a recommendation online? Add wines to your wishlist so you remember what to try next.

LEARN AS YOU GO
Uncorked shares fun facts about your wines — regional history, food pairings, and tasting tips — so you can build confidence without the pretension.

YOUR DATA STAYS YOURS
Everything is stored locally on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking. Your wine journey is private.

Perfect for the wine curious — people who love wine but don't need to be experts about it.
