# Privacy Policy

**Uncorked** — Wine Collection App
Last updated: January 2026

## Overview

Uncorked is a personal wine cataloging app. Your data stays on your device. We don't have accounts, servers, or any way to access your information.

## What Data We Collect

### Wine Photos
When you photograph a wine label, the image is sent to Google's AI service (Gemini) to extract wine information (name, winery, region, etc.). Google processes this data according to their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Your Wine Collection
All wines, tasting notes, ratings, and other data you enter are stored **locally on your device only**. We do not have access to this data.

## What We Don't Do

- We don't create user accounts
- We don't sync data to any server
- We don't track your behavior or location
- We don't show advertisements
- We don't sell or share your data
- We don't use analytics or tracking SDKs

## Data Storage & Deletion

Your wine collection is stored on your iPhone using Apple's on-device database. To delete your data, simply delete the app — all data is removed with it.

## Third-Party Services

| Service | Purpose | Data Shared |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Google Gemini AI | Extract wine info from label photos | Wine label images |
| Firebase | AI service infrastructure | Wine label images (processed, not stored) |

## Children's Privacy

Uncorked is not intended for users under 17 years of age (wine-related content).

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, we'll post the new version here with an updated date.
